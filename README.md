# VRCCamLock

Make the VRCCam auto lock to a specifc spot. Great for Thumbnails.

Create an [Empty Game Object] or use the [Main Camera Object] and place it to a location where the Z axis is looking at the image plane in your scene.

Add the "VRCCamLock" component script in the inspector.

That's it, after you hit build and publish, the script will look for an Object named "VRCCam" and it will then lock its position to the script Object location.

You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/Riyshin/VRCCamLock/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">HERE</a>.
